- One useful way to think about JavaScript is to think of all of the code we're writing as happening inside of a function.

- Conditionals can be thought of in English sentences to discover their variables, i.e.
  - If it is X, then I will Y
  - If it is raining, then I will cry
  - If it is sunny, then I will dance
  - If X = 2, then increment X by 1
    - Else decrement X by 1
    
Q. _Where does complex logic filter in? Not everything in the world can be filtered into a set of binary options; variables may not be known, or still being discovered._
